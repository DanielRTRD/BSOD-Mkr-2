                    <TextBlock Text="BSOD Mkr is an easy to use software that displays a fake BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) Windows error on your screen. This efficient and intuitive application is a great tool which you could use in order to easily play practical jokes on your friends, family and colleagues." TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow" />

                    <TextBlock Text="Installation is not a prerequisite, which makes BSOD Mkr portable. You can drop the program files anywhere on the hard disk and just click the executable to run. There is also the possibility of saving BSOD Mkr to a USB flash drive or similar storage unit, in order to run it on any PC with minimum effort, as long as it has .NET Framework installed."

                    <TextBlock Text=""/>
                    <TextBlock Text="An important aspect to take into account is that the Windows registry does not get updated with new entries, and no other files are created on the disk without your consent. The interface is friendly and available in two modes, depending on the user's skill level: basic and advanced. It is possible to choose the BSOD color between blue (original) and black, enable or disable keyboard and mouse control, specify the BSOD display duration (between 15 seconds and 10 minutes), as well as choose the screen resolution (preset or custom)."

                    <TextBlock Text="BSOD Mkr was started back in autumn of 2009 when Daniel and his friend, Andreas, was talking about how fun it would be to see our brothers faces when their computer got a BSOD. The development was great in the beginning but after a short while it wasn't updated for a year. So in November of 2010 it was updated to 1.0. A year later, in September of 2011, then it was updated again and it was held updated thru 2012. Then in 2014 Daniel started development of v2.0, this application, and the development stopped in April of 2015. Now over five years later Daniel decided to publish this for the world to see."

                    <TextBlock Text="'The app is low-demanding when it comes to CPU and RAM, so it does not affect the overall performance of the PC. It executes commands rapidly and works well, without actually causing Windows to hang, crash or pop up the real Blue Screen of Death. We have not come across any issues in our tests. All in all, BSOD Mkr serves its purpose and can be used by anyone.'" TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow" />
